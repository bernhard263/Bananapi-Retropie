# Bananapi-Retropie

-- Update February 2021 --

While this still works, I consider it obsolete and advise against installing it. I noticed an annoying screen tearing / scrolling lag issue that makes this Retropie setup not fun to play. If you want to use the Banana Pi as a retro gaming machine, please use my build of Lakka for the Banana Pi instead, see the links below.
